<p>Cross-Module Analysis (CMA) is link time checking and is performed once all of the source files have been analyzed. CMA must be enabled to fully enforce a coding standard.</p>
<p><strong>Note that CMA may take a long time to complete</strong>. If enabled it will always be run regardless of the dependency based analysis setting.</p>
