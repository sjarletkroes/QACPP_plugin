<div>
    For each data field a <i>Threshold</i> or <i>Improvement</i> can be set: 
    <ul>
	    <li><i>Threshold</i> indicates that the build must have less or equal messages than the value specified or the build will be marked as unstable.</li>
	    <li><i>Improvement</i> indicates that the amount of messages must be less or equal to the number of messages found in previous build or the build will be marked as unstable.</li>
	</ul>
    The default value <i>None</i> means that this field is ignored, so it can have any value without affecting the build stability.
    Threshold levels are displayed on the trending graphs.
    
    <h4>Messages</h4>
    This is the total number of messages on all levels for all the files in the project. Messages in header files are de-duplicated (they are only counted once and not for each source file the header is included into). 
	<h4>Project Compliance Index</h4>
    This is the percentage of message groups (a coding standard &quot;rule&quot;) for which there are no messages in the project. 
	<h4>File Compliance Index</h4>
    This is the mean across all files of the percentage of message groups (a coding standard &quot;rule&quot;) for which there are no messages in each file. 

    <p>A high File Compliance Index and low Project Compliance Index indicates that each file violates only a small number of rules but each file violates a different rule.
    </p>
    <p>
If the Compliance Indices are close then each file is violating more or less the same rules.
    </p>
    <p>
    Note that you can have thresholds set on more than one item - if <i>any</i> of the data fields fall below their threshold then the build will be marked as unstable.
