Decrease the amount of time to analyze the project by only analyzing source files that need analysis.

Only source files that have changed or have no previous analysis output will be analyzed. All the header files included (both directly and indirectly) are considered part of the source file when looking for changes. Files that have up to date analysis output will not be analysed.
