Controls if the source code is uploaded to QA&middot;Verify.
<ul>
    <li><i>All code uploaded </i>will unconditionally upload all source and header files to QA&middot;Verify so it will not need to access the repository. You can, however, still use the VCS during upload to get the file versions and authors - specify a VCS configuration file below.</li>
    <li><i>No code uploaded</i> will not upload any code: QA&middot;Verify will retrieve all required code from the repository. You <b>must</b> specify a VCS configuration file below.</li>
    <li><i>Only code not in VCS</i> will only upload files that are not in the Version Control System (e.g. generated files). Files that are in the repository will not be uploaded.</li> 
</ul>
