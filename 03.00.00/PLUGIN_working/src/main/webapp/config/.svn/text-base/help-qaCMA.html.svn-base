    Cross-Module Analysis (CMA) is link time checking and is performed once all of the source files have been analyzed.
    CMA must be enabled to fully enforce a coding standard.

    Note that CMA may take a long time to complete.
    If enabled, it will always be run regardless of the dependency based analysis setting.
