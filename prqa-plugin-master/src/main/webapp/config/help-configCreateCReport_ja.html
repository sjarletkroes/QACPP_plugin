<p>
The Compliance Report shows how well the project complies with the Coding Standard. 
</p>
<p>
A Summary is shown on the cover page giving details of the size of the project and violations of the Coding Standard. Two compliance indices are shown to give an indication of the adherence to the Coding Standard. The report contains a compliance matrix and tables showing the worst files, most violated message groups and file compliance. 
</p>
<p>
If this report is generated then the Plugin will produce a graphical trend for the total number of messages and file and compliance indices for each build. You can also set thresholds for this data: if the build fails to meet the thresholds it will be marked unstable.
