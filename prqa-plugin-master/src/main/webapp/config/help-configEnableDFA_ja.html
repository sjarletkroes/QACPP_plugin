<p>
Enable deep-flow dataflow analysis. If dataflow is already enabled in the PRQA project, this option has no effect.
</p>

If dataflow is not enabled in the PRQA project, then enabling it here will make it use the default timeouts. If you want to customize the timeouts and dataflow options you must set the PRQA project to use a User Defined dataflow personality. This file should contain just the dataflow settings and <b>not</b> the <tt>-EnableDataflow+</tt> or <tt>-ed+</tt> option to turn on dataflow (or it will be always enabled). For example:
<pre>
*Dataflow is enabled when analysis launched from Jenkins
*Use 10 seconds timeout
-po df::query_timeout=100001
-po df::function_timeout=100000
*Maximum interfunction depth
-po df::inter=5
</pre>
